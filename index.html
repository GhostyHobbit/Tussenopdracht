                <p>Violet Sorrengail joins as cadet for the Riders Quadrant after being trained for the Scribe Quadrant all her life.
                    The Riders Quadrant is ruthless and the weak either get killed by circumstances or classmates or they get incinerated by the dragons they are supposed to fly. Being called weak and breakable because of her chronic disease,
                    it seems that Violet doesn't have  a big chance at surviving this violent place.
                </p>
                <p>Xaden Riorson is the son of a rebellious leader. The same leader who got executed at the command of no other than General Sorrengail, Violets mother.
                    Xaden also is one of the most powerful students the College has ever seen. Violets life doesn't get any easier by the
                    lurking threat of getting killed for revenge.
                </p>
                <p>How will she survive in a place where everything and everyone wants her dead? What will she do once she is forced closer to danger and finds 
                    herself dangerously attracted to it?
                </p>
                <p>
